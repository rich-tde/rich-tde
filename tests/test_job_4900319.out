#### Test started
## Which node is this: node861
How many cores do I have access to: 15
Am I loading the from the right module path
/easybuild/modules/all
## Where am I: /home/hey4/rich_tde/tests
## My local scratch space on the node is: /scratchdata/hey4/4900319
## Let us go there: /scratchdata/hey4/4900319
## Let us copy the C script to it
cp: cannot stat '/home/hey4/rich_tde/tests/omp_hello.c': No such file or directory
## Is the file there?
ls: cannot access 'omp_hello.c': No such file or directory
## Now we compile it on the node
cc1: fatal error: omp_hello.c: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
## Let us run it
slurmstepd: error: execve(): /scratchdata/hey4/4900319/./omp_hello_amd: No such file or directory
slurmstepd: error: execve(): /scratchdata/hey4/4900319/./omp_hello_amd: No such file or directory
slurmstepd: error: execve(): /scratchdata/hey4/4900319/./omp_hello_amd: No such file or directory
slurmstepd: error: execve(): /scratchdata/hey4/4900319/./omp_hello_amd: No such file or directory
slurmstepd: error: execve(): /scratchdata/hey4/4900319/./omp_hello_amd: No such file or directory
srun: error: node861: tasks 0-4: Exited with exit code 2
## Saving files that should be saved.
cp: cannot stat '/scratchdata/hey4/4900319/omp_hello_amd': No such file or directory
## Now that this is done, I want to go home
## Good to be back /home/hey4/rich_tde/tests
